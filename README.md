# .bash_profile

## Usage 
Clone the repo, and source `index.sh` in your `.bashrc` or `.profile`.  
For example, if you cloned this repo in your home directory, use this line:
```bash
. ~/.bash_config/index.sh
```

By default, local settings will be loaded from the `local_settings` directory at the root of this repo. This folder can be changed by editing the `LOCAL_SETTINGS` variable in `index.sh`.
